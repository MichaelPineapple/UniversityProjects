This program is written in Python 2.7

!!! IMPORTANT: The 'clasp.exe' file MUST be in the same directory as the 'Main.py' script or the program will not function properly !!!

The source file 'Main.py' and 'clasp.exe' are both located in the 'src' directory of this submission.


*** BUILD AND RUN INSTRUCTIONS ***
----------------------------------

Option A: If you are using Windows with Python installed, you can likely double-click on 'Main.py' to run the program.

Option B: If you prefer to use the command-line, use:
> C:/python27/python.exe .../Main.py
('...' means whatever directory in which you currently have the scriped located.)
(If your 'python.exe' is in a different directory or you are using an operating system other than windows, please take those factors into consideration.)

Option C: You can also load 'Main.py' into an IDE of your choice, so long as it handles python, and run it from there.
